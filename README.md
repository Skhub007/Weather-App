# Weather-App

"This weather app allows users to search for and view current weather conditions for locations around the world.
The app is built using React.js and makes use of the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve and display real-time weather data."

### Technologies Used 


1.HTML

2.CSS

3.React.js

4.JavaScript

5.Weather by API-Ninjas API

6.Bootstrap (for styling)


### How it works

The user enters a location into the search bar and submits the form.
The app makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, passing the location as a parameter.
The API returns current weather data for the location, including temperature, humidity, and a weather icon.
The app processes the data and displays it to the user in a visually appealing format.




## Installation
To run this app, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:




npm install

npm start

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the development server. The app will be available at http://localhost:3000/.

## Future plans
Add support for multiple locations and the ability to compare weather data side-by-side.
Implement a dark mode option for users.
Add more detailed weather data, such as wind speed and forecasted conditions.
